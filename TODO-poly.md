see if we can implement Num in the NonEmpty impl
see if we can use a Stream impl with implying infinite zeroes and then stop rendering at the last zero
see if we can have an indexed impl e.g. [(1, 1), (2, 4)] for x+2x^4
see if it's faster to use arrays or vectors - use speed testing suite in other914
